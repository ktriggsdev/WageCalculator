Hello, This is a program to calculate your weekly, monthly and annual wages based on the hourly wage you have.
To start, please enter your name

Next enter your starting wage type: hourly (h), weekly (w), monthly (m) or annually (a)

Then enter whether you wish to use Dollars (d) or Pounds (p)

Finally enter your wage without the $ or Â£ symbols and in price format.

The program will then calculate your weekly, monthly and annual wages

Thanks for using this program, the program was designed and coded with ðŸ’š by Kieran Triggs, Software Engineer & Python Developer.
